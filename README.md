# BitcoinTX – Bitcoin Portfolio & Tax Tracker

**BitcoinTX** is a free, open-source Bitcoin portfolio tracker and tax report generator.

It tracks your BTC and USD balances using **double-entry accounting** and helps you calculate FIFO-based capital gains, cost basis, and income for IRS reporting. It includes a full-featured dashboard, a manual transaction entry form, and exportable reports like Form 8949 and Schedule D.
