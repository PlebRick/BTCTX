"""
transaction.py

Refactored to incorporate the full double-entry design with separate models:
1) Transaction (header record)
2) LedgerEntry (individual debit/credit lines)
3) BitcoinLot (tracking BTC acquired for FIFO)
4) LotDisposal (partial usage of BitcoinLots on disposal)

We keep everything in one file to maintain your 3-file approach:
(transaction.py, account.py, user.py). Extensive comments clarify each model and its fields.

CHANGES:
- Removed 'account_id' and 'account' from LotDisposal. 
- Added a 'account = relationship("Account", back_populates="ledger_entries")' in LedgerEntry
  so it matches account.py's 'ledger_entries = relationship(..., back_populates="account")'.
This resolves the "Mapper ... has no property 'account'" error and adheres to 
standard double-entry design.

    'Transaction' is the high-level "header" record in the double-entry system.
    Each Transaction can have multiple LedgerEntries (line items) that
    record actual debits/credits. It can also create BitcoinLot(s) if acquiring BTC,
    or create LotDisposal(s) if disposing of previously acquired BTC.

    This model no longer depends on single-entry columns like amount or fee_amount
    for the final ledger amounts, since those live in LedgerEntry now. However,
    we keep optional 'from_account_id', 'to_account_id', 'amount', etc. as LEGACY
    fields for backward compatibility or user-facing convenience.

    cost_basis_usd, proceeds_usd, realized_gain_usd, and holding_period can be updated
