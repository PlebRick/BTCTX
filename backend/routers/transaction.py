"""
backend/routers/transaction.py

Router for Transaction endpoints in a full double-entry environment.
The user might still pass single-entry fields (from_account_id, amount, etc.),
but the service transforms them into LedgerEntries plus optional BTC lot usage.

We keep these endpoints minimal, delegating actual multi-line ledger creation,
BTC lot tracking (BitcoinLot), and disposal (LotDisposal) to the service layer.

Refactor Notes:
 - We ensure that all datetime fields are coerced to UTC (tzinfo=timezone.utc)
   before returning them. Then we convert to ISO8601 with trailing 'Z' instead
   of '+00:00'.
 - This applies to both the "list" route and "get by ID" route, ensuring
   consistent format across the entire API.
 - Added a 404 check in get_transaction(tx_id).
 - Otherwise, we've retained your existing create, update, and delete endpoints.
