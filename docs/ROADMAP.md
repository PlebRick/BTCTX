# Roadmap

## Current Priority: Beta Testing & Refinement

With StartOS packaging complete, focus shifts to testing and refining the application for production use.

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] **2025 IRS form updates**: Update Form 8949/Schedule D templates when IRS releases 2025 versions
- [ ] **CSV import**: Bulk import transactions from exchange exports
- [ ] **Improved error handling**: Better user feedback for failed operations

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Multi-year reports**: Generate reports spanning multiple tax years
- [ ] **Cost basis methods**: Support LIFO, specific identification (not just FIFO)
- [ ] **Transaction categories**: Tags/labels for transaction organization
- [ ] **Data validation**: Audit tool to verify ledger balance integrity

### Low Priority / Nice-to-Have
- [ ] **Multi-user support**: Separate portfolios for household members
- [ ] **Exchange API sync**: Optional automatic import from exchanges
- [ ] **Dark mode**: UI theme toggle
- [ ] **Mobile responsive**: Better mobile layout

## Notes

- **Philosophy**: Get basic functionality working first, refine edge cases later
- **Git workflow**: `develop` branch for work, merge to `master` for releases
- **Testing**: Manual testing preferred; automated tests exist but coverage is limited
