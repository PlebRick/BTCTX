"""
Test that backdated transactions trigger proper FIFO recalculation.

Scenario:
1. Create Buy A on 2024-02-01 for 1 BTC at $40,000
2. Create Buy B on 2024-03-01 for 1 BTC at $50,000
3. Create Sell on 2024-04-01 for 1 BTC (should consume Buy A at $40k)
4. Create backdated Buy C on 2024-01-01 for 1 BTC at $30,000
5. After recalculation, Sell should now consume Buy C at $30k (oldest lot first)

Expected Result:
- Before backdated insert: Sell cost basis = $40,000 (from Buy A)
- After backdated insert: Sell cost basis = $30,000 (from Buy C)
